##  Features

  Use expressive, animated on-screen commentators that react in real time to your audio.

-  **Multimedia Integration**  
  Overlay animated avatars. Perfect for introducing commentators.

-  **Live Remote Commentary**  
  Friends can join remotely via Discordâ€”whatever they say or react to gets reflected in OBS thanks to the seamless audio channel.

##  How It Works

1. **Install VB-Audio Virtual Cable** â€“ acts as a virtual audio bridge between apps. (only required for friends via Discord)
2. **Setup audio routing** â€“ configure your game/voice app to output to the VBCable input. (only required for friends via Discord) 
3. **Open Spotters & OBS** â€“ Spotters listens your mic and to the VBCable output to trigger avatar animations or media overlays. 
4. **Start streaming** â€“ your animated commentators come alive in your broadcast, and friends calling in via Discord are smoothly integrated.
